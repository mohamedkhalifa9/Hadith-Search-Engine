# Hadith-Search-Engine
This project implements a multilingual search engine for Islamic hadiths from Sahih Muslim's collection. It enables users to search through hadith texts using natural language queries in Arabic. The system combines modern natural language processing with traditional Islamic texts by utilizing vector embeddings and semantic search capabilities.

The search engine translates Arabic queries to English, then uses semantic matching to find relevant hadiths from its database. It leverages ChromaDB for efficient vector storage and retrieval, and employs advanced language models for accurate Arabic-to-English translation. The system maintains a persistent database of hadith embeddings, allowing for quick and relevant search results.
